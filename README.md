# LotusPhoto

This is a personal photo gallery project I'm currently building.  
The goal is to create a clean and simple platform where I can display my photos, categorize them, and eventually offer them for sale.

The project is still under development, but the core features are already working.

## What it does (so far)

- Displays a collection of photos with categories like "Landscape", "Portrait", etc.
- Responsive frontend built with React and TailwindCSS
- Backend built with ASP.NET Core Web API
- Each photo has a detail page (title, category, price)

## How to run it locally

### Backend (ASP.NET Core)
1. Navigate to the `backend` folder
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio (`LotusPhoto.sln`)
3. Run the `LotusPhoto.Api` project

It will be available at: https://localhost:7245

### Frontend (React + Vite)
To run the frontend locally using Visual Studio Code:

1. Open the folder: frontend/LotusPhoto.Web in VS Code
2. Open Terminal from Terminal => New Terminal
3. Run: npm install
4. Run: npm run dev
 
Then open your browser at: http://localhost:5173
Make sure the backend is running before using the frontend
